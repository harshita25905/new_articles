This project aims to classify news articles into different categories such as Sports, Technology, Business, etc., using article metadata like word count, presence of keywords, and estimated read time.

Since the dataset does not include the full text of articles, the classification is based only on these limited features. A Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict the article category.
The project also evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and visualizes the confusion matrix with a heatmap.

Key Steps:

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

Training a machine learning model

Model evaluation and visualization

Preparing detailed performance reports

Libraries Used:
pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
